# Project Assignment README

## Project Overview

This project assignment involves creating and managing a project plan using ProjectLibre. The primary tasks include setting up the project environment, designing and developing various components, and ensuring all necessary documentation is prepared and submitted. The project is scheduled to run from September 1, 2024, to September 9, 2024, with each task having specific start and end dates.

## Project Tasks

The project begins with the *Initial Setup and Research, starting on September 1, 2024, and ending on September 2, 2024. This phase involves setting up the project environment and conducting preliminary research on the required tools and technologies. Following this, the **Design UML Class Diagram* task will be carried out from September 2, 2024, to September 3, 2024. This task is dependent on the completion of the initial setup and research and focuses on designing the UML class diagram as per project requirements.

Next, the *Develop Database Structure* task will take place from September 3, 2024, to September 4, 2024. This task relies on the completion of the UML class diagram and involves developing the database structure accordingly. After the database structure is developed, the *Create WPF Windows and UI Design* task will commence from September 4, 2024, and continue until September 6, 2024. This task depends on the database structure and involves creating WPF windows and designing the user interface.

Following the UI design, the project will move to the *Implement GUI Navigation and Layout* phase, scheduled from September 7, 2024, to September 8, 2024. This task, which depends on the completion of WPF windows and UI design, focuses on implementing the navigation and layout within the graphical user interface. On September 9, 2024, the *Prepare Documentation and Report* task will be completed in a single day. This task is contingent upon the successful implementation of GUI navigation and layout and involves preparing the final documentation and report.

The *Commit to GitHub (5 commits)* task will run from September 6, 2024, to September 9, 2024. During this period, regular commits will be made to GitHub to track the project's progress. Finally, the *Submit Assignment* task will take place on September 9, 2024, and requires the completion of all previous tasks. This task involves submitting the finished assignment according to project guidelines.

## Project Timeline

The project spans from September 1, 2024, to September 9, 2024. Each task has been scheduled with specific start and end dates, and it is crucial to adhere to these deadlines to ensure timely completion. Delays should be addressed promptly to stay on track with the overall project timeline.

## Dependencies

Task dependencies are crucial for managing project flow. The *Design UML Class Diagram* task is dependent on the *Initial Setup and Research. Similarly, the **Develop Database Structure* task depends on the *Design UML Class Diagram. The **Create WPF Windows and UI Design* task follows the completion of the *Develop Database Structure, and the **Implement GUI Navigation and Layout* task depends on the completion of the *Create WPF Windows and UI Design. The **Prepare Documentation and Report* task is contingent upon the successful implementation of GUI navigation and layout, and the *Submit Assignment* task depends on the completion of the documentation and report.

## Notes

It is essential to track and update tasks regularly within ProjectLibre. Ensure that all dependencies are resolved before progressing to subsequent tasks. Regular GitHub commits should be made to reflect ongoing progress throughout the project. If any issues or queries arise, please reach out for assistance
